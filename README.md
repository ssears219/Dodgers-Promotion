# Dodgers Promotion

Using a regression model to choose the best night to have a promotion at Dodgers baseball game.

## Description

Given a dataset that includes Dodgers attendance, opponent, day, weather, time, and which promotion was run if any, can we determine which day of the week would be best to run a promotion?
In this project I analyze Dodgers attendance data associated with promotions to figure out which night would be 'best' to run a promotion. My metric for determining which night was best was expected attendance since attendence translates to revenue.
I determined that if we ran a promotion (any promotion), the day of the week that was associated with the largest increase in attendence would be Saturday.
